## Features

- **Visual graph editor** — drag, connect, and organise nodes on an infinite canvas
- **12 node types** — NPC lines, player choices, branching, variables, audio, animator triggers, events, waits, and more
- **Built-in variable store** — Bool / Int / String variables with inline conditions on choices — no C# needed
- **Text token substitution** — embed variable values directly in dialogue: `You have {gold} {gold:name}`
- **Entry points** — jump into any branch of a graph based on story state
- **Spatial audio** — per-speaker 3D audio source positioning
- **Animator integration** — set parameters on any registered speaker's Animator
- **Custom conditions** — register C# delegates or a `ConditionProvider` asset for complex game state
- **Edit-mode preview window** — step through any graph without entering Play mode
- **Choice history** — track visited choices with save/load serialization
- **Singleton `DialogueManager`** — one component drives everything; subscribe to events from any script

## Minimum setup

Five steps to a working dialogue:

1. **Create** a `Dialogue Graph` asset — right-click in the Project window → **Create → Threader → Dialogue Graph**
2. **Build** the conversation — double-click the asset to open the graph editor
3. **Add** a `DialogueManager` component to an empty GameObject in the scene
4. **Call** `DialogueManager.Instance.StartDialogue(graph)` from your interaction code
5. **Wire** the UI — add `DialogueUI` to a GameObject, or subscribe to `OnNPCLine` / `OnChoiceNode` for a fully custom UI
